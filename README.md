# Yolo-Colab-Implementation
All you need is this Colab notebook!

YOLO is a real-time object-detection system that relies on a single CNN (convolutional neural network) to perform object detection on images and pre-recorded or streaming videos. YOLO relies on one single neural network for the detection pipeline - making it faster and easier to train than other detection frameworks that rely on more than one network. 

In this example, we will be implementing YOLOv3, a recent version of YOLO, using Google Colab. The goal is that anyone can open this Colab notebook, run it, and be able to use YOLOv3.
